# NoSQL_challenge
I am helping a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love to evaluate the hygiene rating of the restaurant released by The UK Food Standards Agency.  
There are 3 files in the repository: the raw data, establishment.json and 2 jupyter workbook, NoSQL_setup_starter,ipynb and NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb.
Part 1 
I imported the json file from the terminal, named the database "uk_food" and the collection "establishments".
Part 2
Create a dictionary and update the database with the new restaurant collection.
Convert the format of longitude and latitude to decimal.
Convert format of Ratings from string to integer. 
Part 3
Answer the analysis questions:
1. Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?
2. Which establishments in London have a Rating Value greater than or equal to 4?
3. What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue rating value of 5, sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?
4. How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0?
Please review the code from the attached files.
